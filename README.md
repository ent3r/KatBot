# This is a work in progress

The project was initially meant to simply be a Discord bot with simple functions.\
I quickly realized I wanted to add functions to it which aren't strictly Discord-related.\
For that reason, I've decided to release this and push out my progress as I go along with syncing it up with my website and/or an Electron app I am creating as a side project.

## Features

Extremely limited, but gives a good baseline for addition of features by others.
- Moderation tools (kick, mute, ban, warn and logs for each)
- Other Commands (!run, !inv)
- Simple logging if enabled


## Usage

- This is for personal use, and connects to a mysql database for keeping the logs.
- If you really want to use this branch, ask me about it in [my discord server](https://discord.gg/rcqvn76)
