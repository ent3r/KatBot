# This is a work in progress

The project was initially meant to simply be a Discord bot with simple functions.\
I quickly realized I wanted to add functions to it which aren't strictly Discord-related.\
For that reason, I've decided to release this and push out my progress as I go along with syncing it up with my website and/or an Electron app I am creating as a side project.

If you want to run the bot itself, use [master](https://github.com/Heijos/KatBot).
